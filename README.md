# Nesh-Scraper-Project
The Web Scraping Project done as part of Nesh's coding assignment. Link to the demo video can be [found here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fmk0L6iQZ5dNppVc4SO9IKDCMI4GDdxf/view?usp=sharing).

All of the code is written Python3.

Libraries needed to run the jupyter notebook:
  - BeautifulSoup 4 (to scrape websites)
  - NLTK (to summarize news articles)

To run the Nesh_Project.ipynb notebook, download the notebook and the helper_functions.py file. helper_functions contains all the functions that will be used in the jupyter notebook, so download it into the same directory where the Nesh_Project.ipynb notebook was downloaded. I recommend using the Conda distribution for launching the Jupyter notebook, since it comes pre-installed with commonly used Python libraries.

After that, simply follow the directions given in the Jupyter notebook and run each cell as instructed.

Thank you for your time!
