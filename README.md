# Nesh-Scraper-Project
The Web Scraping Project done as part of Nesh's coding assignment.

All of the code is written Python3.

Libraries needed to run the jupyter notebook:
  - BeautifulSoup 4 (to scrape websites)
  - NLTK (to summarize news articles)

To run the Nesh_Project.ipynb notebook, download the notebook and the helper_functions.py file. helper_functions contains all the functions that will be used in the jupyter notebook, so download it into the same directory where the Nesh_Project.ipynb notebook was downloaded.

After that, simply follow the directions given in the Jupyter notebook and run each cell as instructed.

Thank you for your time!
