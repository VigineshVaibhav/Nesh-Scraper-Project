      "Pioneer's strong oil output during the fourth quarter helped the company generate a gusher of cash flow. Those contracts helped net Pioneer an incremental $173 million in cash during the quarter and $458 million for the full year. It was a solid end to the year, as its Permian production came in toward the top end of its guidance range. Meanwhile, the company unveiled this week that it's giving investors another raise by increasing its dividend 100%. The company started forking over more money last February when it boosted its dividend 300%, while also authorizing a small $100 million share-repurchase plan. Because of that, it has been able to return more cash to shareholders in the past year. Unfortunately, most investors focused on that earnings miss, which likely means they overlooked three excellent numbers that the company revealed. With that boost, the company has now raised its payout by a jaw-dropping 700% in the past year.\n",

      "I've already mentioned that 2019 is going to be a strong capital efficiency year. That point in time, you got a significant bump to your available cash flow, and therefore, a push toward free cash flow generation. And so it's going to give us a tremendous advantage going forward. So I think all those things combined together are going to lead to a greater capital discipline in 2019. So we're trying to balance all those things in order to get the most capital efficient program we can each year. Inventory of low risk wells, high return wells, that give us runway or a pathway to long-term organic growth. One of the things, we are trying to achieve of course is moving the Company to where we're generating free cash flow. And we want to push the Company toward the free cash flow generative model, of course, and at the same time, be growing.\n",

      "The company aims to buy back another $9 billion in stock in the coming years, or about $15 billion overall. While its $4 billion authorization isn't the highest amount, it is enough money to retire a remarkable 20% of Devon's outstanding stock. The latest one comes from Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD), which is planning to repurchase $2 billion of its stock. Finally, the company anticipates that it will generate free cash flow in 2019 even after funding a growth-focused capital program. Meanwhile, that buyback only intended to offset the dilution associated with the company's annual employee stock awards. Given the current share price, it could retire about 8% of its outstanding shares. That makes it a compelling oil stock to consider for the long term. Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is currently undertaking one of the biggest buyback programs in the sector.\n",

Unfortunately, the frack sand business is an incredibly tough one for generating long-term returns. Long-term supply contracts coupled with logistics services will help protect revenue and margins. With a better business model and a dirt-cheap stock price, investors should take a hard look at U.S. Silica's stock.
